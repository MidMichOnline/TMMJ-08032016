Carrie Fancett Pagels, Ph.D., award winning author of several novels and novellas, visited the Shepherd Community Library Monday afternoon. She spoke to attendees about her writing methods and later toured the Train Depot.

Pagels recently researched Shepherd's history while writing the Christian historical romance novella, "The Substitute Bride." The story takes place in the Village of Shepherd during the 1890â€™s and references several key landmarks, and is one of the finalists for the Maggie Award for Excellence.

"Carrie was warm and enthusiastic about meeting people from Shepherd. She actually came just to meet us and see historical sites," said Joyce Noyes, Shepherd Area Historical Society secretary.

Before becoming an author, Pagels was a psychologist for 25 years. She is originally from Newberry, Michigan.
