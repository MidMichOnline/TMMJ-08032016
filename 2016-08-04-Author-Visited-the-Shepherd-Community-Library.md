Carrie Fancett Pangels, Ph.D., author of several novels and novellas, visited the Shepherd Community Library Monday afternoon. She spoke to attendees about her writing methods and later toured the Train Depot.

Pangels recently researched Shepherd's history while writing the Christian historical romance novella, "The Substitute Bride." The story takes place in the Village of Shepherd during the 1890â€™s and references several key landmarks.
