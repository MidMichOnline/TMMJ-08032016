# SPD Updates

From the [Shepherd Police Department](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1253705261314706&id=205632619455314)

Good morning everyone! 3 quick things....

* The Woman's Self Defense Seminar date has been set for October 15th. Please mark that on your calendar if you are interested. More details to come in the upcoming weeks.

* Have you accepted my challenge to help out the Foster Closet of Michigan's Mt. Pleasant location? If you haven't...why not? For a few $'s, you can provide needed items to a foster child. Remember, they are looking for new packages of socks (boys and girls, all sizes), new packages of underwear (boys and girls, all sizes), new pillows and men's deodorant. These items can be dropped off at our office as we attempt to bury Officer Janofski's desk before he returns!

* If you have a student at the Shepherd Middle School, your child is going to be blown away by a project that Principal Kelly Miscikoski and I are coming up with for this school year involving "acts of kindness."

I'll end with quote by Milton Berle..."If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door."

Chief Sawyer
